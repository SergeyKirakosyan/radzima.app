Env variables are required in order to autogenerate feedbacks, if you want to proceed without it, you can create feedbacks.json file in `src\_data\_cache` with the following content, for example: 
```
[
  {
    "author": "alexey komov",
    "source": "app store",
    "rate": 5,
    "body": "Itâ€™s good to have such content in one place. Do you plan to add more languages and maybe in-app purchases of excursions?",
    "image": "5e8cab3b51a75706f7720c866e181446.svg"
  },
  {
    "author": "mich dreby",
    "source": "app store",
    "rate": 5,
    "body": "One of the best apps in the world from really senior developers!",
    "image": "17e66694089629a9f49d8960c2920d08.svg"
